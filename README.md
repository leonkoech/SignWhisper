### Introduction
 
Welcome to Beesper! We live in a world rich with diverse ways of communicating, but for some, expressing themselves through American Sign Language (ASL) can be challenging. Traditional methods of learning ASL, such as books and videos, lack the immersive and interactive experience needed to master this beautiful language. ASL is not just about words; it's about connection.
 
Beesper is here to change the game! Our Virtual Reality (VR) application transforms the way you learn ASL by providing an engaging and immersive experience packed with minigames designed to help learn/practice signing. We bring ASL to life in a virtual world where learning is as fun as playing your favorite video game.
